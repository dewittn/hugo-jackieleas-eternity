Hi there! I’m Jackie Lea Shelley, and I like you already. Probably.

I am an Idealist, Mama, and Warrior Princess. I am not an aardvark, but I am an artist. I have been painting in watercolors for over 15 years. Every portrait I create is done with intense love, with a deep desire to show other people how beautiful they are and how beautiful is their love for each other. Also, with plenty of coffee. My hobbies are being obnoxious on the internet, researching bikinis during winter rainstorms, and making beautiful things that get me so excited that I forget to eat. Boobs and spreadsheets are two of my favorite things.

I also like chocolate pie, sunsets, pianos, and very small humans and cats. I love my offspring like anything. I’m a geek, I overthink everything, forget to finish most of the things I start, and like Wednesdays.

I collect adventures and beautiful people. I have mad ADHD, occasionally debilitating social anxiety, arithmophobia, and am probably one of the most loyal people you will ever meet.

I make art that helps save lives.
